## Adding an RMarkdown Template

This file is what a user will see when they select your template. Make sure that you update the fields in the yaml header. In particular you will want to update the `output` field to whatever format your template requires.

This is a good place to demonstrate special features that your template provides. Ideally it should knit out-of-the-box, or at least contain clear instructions as to what needs changing.

Finally, be sure to remove this message!


## Filler Text
Where does Philadelphiaâ€™s drinking water come from?  
  
The sources of the water supply for Philadelphia are the Delaware River (or estuary) and the Schuykill River.
The Queen Lane and Belmont Water Treatment Plants withdraw water from the Schuylkill River. The Samuel Baxter Water Treatment Plant withdraws water from the Delaware River.  
  
All three treatment plants use chlorine as the primary disinfectant and conventional dual-media filtration. The treatment process entails pre-sedimentation, coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection. The finished water contains a chloramine (chlorine combined with ammonia) residual for secondary disinfection, fluoride for dental health, and zinc orthophosphate for corrosion control.
