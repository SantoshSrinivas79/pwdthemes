## PWD Report RMarkdown Template

This is an example report that was created using the `pwdthemes::pwd_report` template. This template provides a set pdf layout for making reports in R that are styled with PWD logos. This template was designd with the hopes that it will reduce the burden of styling pdf outputs on users. Often, LaTeX can be a major headache if you are not familiar with it. In order to help you avoid these headaches, I have compiled some of the things I have figured out regarding LaTeX styling for you here, so that you don't have to think about it. 

This template will include two images. Both of these images will be in the `images/` directory that is created when you select this template. The first is named `logo.png` and this is the water department logo with the commissioner's, Randy Hayman, name. This logo will appear only on the title page above the title information. The second is named `footer.png` and is the equal oppurtunity text that is a requisite of all PWD documents. This footer will appear on every page at the bottom of the page. The footer can be removed by removing the `footer: true` option from the yaml header of by setting it to `false`. 

The `pageheader` yaml option allows you to set what will be displayed along the heading of each page on the right hand side. This text will be bolded. It will be on the right hand side of the header, opposite the section name which will be on the left hand side. If you do not want a pageheader, you can remove this argument. 

This template also creates commands that can be used to create full-page landscape figures. You would implement it by doing the following:

```
\newpage
\blandscape

# figure

\newpage
\elandscape
```

The `\blandscape` function stands for "Begin Landscape" and starts the new page as a landscape rather than portrait. Likewise, the `\elandscape` function stands for "End Landscape" and ends the landscape on the next page.

Outside of the features mentioned above, all of the normal Rmarkdown features should be applicable to this theme as well. If you find any bugs, please file an issue at the [Github repo](https://github.com/tbradley1013/pwdthemes/issues)


## Filler Text
Where does Philadelphiaâ€™s drinking water come from?  
  
The sources of the water supply for Philadelphia are the Delaware River (or estuary) and the Schuykill River.
The Queen Lane and Belmont Water Treatment Plants withdraw water from the Schuylkill River. The Samuel Baxter Water Treatment Plant withdraws water from the Delaware River.  
  
All three treatment plants use chlorine as the primary disinfectant and conventional dual-media filtration. The treatment process entails pre-sedimentation, coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection. The finished water contains a chloramine (chlorine combined with ammonia) residual for secondary disinfection, fluoride for dental health, and zinc orthophosphate for corrosion control.
