## Adding an RMarkdown Template

This file is what a user will see when they select your template. Make sure that you update the fields in the yaml header. In particular you will want to update the `output` field to whatever format your template requires.

This is a good place to demonstrate special features that your template provides. Ideally it should knit out-of-the-box, or at least contain clear instructions as to what needs changing.

Finally, be sure to remove this message!


## R content

The benefit of using Rmarkdown is that you can easily integrate your text and code into a single document which can then be easily rendered into a publication quality document. You can include R code by using "chunks" as follows:

```{r load-libraries}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(pwdthemes)
```

```{r manipulate-data}
large_diamonds <- diamonds %>% 
  filter(carat > 2.2)
```

You can embed R figures directly into the document. 

```{r plot-large-diamonds, fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
large_diamonds %>% 
  ggplot(aes(price, carat, color = cut)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(
    title = "Diamond Carat vs Price",
    subtitle = "Only Diamonds with carat > 2.2 shown"
  ) + 
  scale_color_pwd("dark")

```

In addition to embedding R figures and code, you can also embed images in the document:
