## PWD Memo RMarkdown Template

This template is designed to create a standard memo template that fits with PWD styles. This style is likely better for shorter reports that are to be distributed throughout multiple groups within PWD. The goal of this template is to make it easy to create reports that integrate text and data without you having to worry about custom LaTeX to be able to make the report look like a memo. 

This template includes two images, similar to the PWD Report tempalte. These images will be in the `images/` subdirectory of the directory that contains the Rmarkdown file. The `footer.png` file is the same as the PWD Report Tempalte and is the footer that is included on all PWD documents. If you do not want to include this image in your memo, than you can set `footer: false` in the YAML of your report. The other image is a PWD logo. This is a logo without the commissioner's name, so that it can fit more easily in the header of the document. 

There are several yaml options that will allow for users to easily change the look and feel of the memo. If you want to 


## R content

The benefit of using Rmarkdown is that you can easily integrate your text and code into a single document which can then be easily rendered into a publication quality document. You can include R code by using "chunks" as follows:

```{r load-libraries}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(pwdthemes)
```

```{r manipulate-data}
large_diamonds <- diamonds %>% 
  filter(carat > 2.2)
```

You can embed R figures directly into the document. 

```{r plot-large-diamonds, fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
large_diamonds %>% 
  ggplot(aes(price, carat, color = cut)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(
    title = "Diamond Carat vs Price",
    subtitle = "Only Diamonds with carat > 2.2 shown"
  ) + 
  scale_color_pwd("dark")

```

In addition to embedding R figures and code, you can also embed images in the document:
