The goal of `pwdthemes` is to provide easy to use theme options for employees of the Philadelphia Water Department within R and Rmarkdown. This package provides color and fill options for `ggplot2` figures. It also provides rmarkdown templates that will allow people to easy produce Rmarkdown reports with PWD branding on them. 

## Installation

If you are within the PWD network, you can install the released version of pwdthemes from [PWD's Internal Package Directory](http://pwdrstudio/bls-cran/) with:

``` r
install.packages("pwdthemes", repos = "http://pwdrstudio/bls-cran/")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tbradley1013/pwdthemes")
```
**NOTE: you will have to have [RTools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) installed in order to install this package using either `install.packages` or `install_github` methods**

## RMarkdown Templates

This package provides several Rmarkdown template. These templates will allow for users to easily create branded PWD documents to share easily. This will hopefully reduce the amount of time and headache that is spent trying to create LaTeX styles for reports that may be preventing people from embracing Rmarkdown for writing their reports. Please note that these templates are not approved by public affairs, so please consult your supervisor before using these templates to share reports outside of the department. The templates that are included with this package are:

  * **PWD Report** - This template creates a report document with a standalone title page, custom page headers and PWD logos. This template is great for any kind of report that you may be writing for PWD. 
  * **PWD Memo** - This template creates a interoffice memo with the customary memo header. This will allow you to easily integrate any R code, simple or complex, into a memo that can be distributed throughout the department.
  * **PWD Meeting Agenda** - This template will allow users to create meeting notes with a custom header.

## Palettes and `ggplot2` scales

This package provides functions that allow you to easily add PWD palettes to `ggplot2` figures. These can be added using the `scale_color_pwd` and `scale_fill_pwd` functions depending on whether you are using the color or fill aesthetic. The palettes provided with these functions are based on the [PWD Styleguide](http://waternet/news/The_New_Philadelphia_Water_Brand/PWD_StyleGuidelines.pdf). The available palettes are shown in the table below.

A few of them will be demonstrated here:

```{r}
library(pwdthemes)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(ggridges)
library(patchwork)
```

```{r}
large_diamonds <- diamonds %>% 
  filter(carat > 2.2)

pc <- ggplot(large_diamonds, aes(price, carat, color = cut)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme_bw()

pf <- ggplot(large_diamonds, aes(price, cut, fill = cut)) + 
  geom_density_ridges() + 
  theme_bw()
```

### Main

```{r main, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 4}
pc_main <- pc + scale_color_pwd("main")
pf_main <- pf + scale_fill_pwd("main")

pc_main + pf_main
```


### Main Dark

```{r main_dark, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 4}
pc_main_d <- pc + scale_color_pwd("main_dark")
pf_main_d <- pf + scale_fill_pwd("main_dark")

pc_main_d + pf_main_d

```


### Dark

```{r dark, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 4}
pc_dark <- pc + scale_color_pwd("dark")
pf_dark <- pf + scale_fill_pwd("dark")

pc_dark + pf_dark

```


### View PWD Palettes

You can view what the palette you choose will look like for any given number of variables using the `view_pwd_palette` function. You simply have to pass the palette you are interested as a character string and the number of levels of color required. If you do not pass a number to the n argument, it will show you the default number of colors for a given palette

```{r view-dark}
view_pwd_palette("dark")
```

```{r view-dark-4}
view_pwd_palette("dark", 4)

```
